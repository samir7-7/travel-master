    excerpt: 'Your comprehensive guide to planning the perfect Thai adventure, from visa requirements to cultural etiquette and travel tips.',
    content: `<p class='text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6'>Thailand, known as the 'Land of Smiles,' welcomes millions of visitors annually. Whether you're planning your first visit or your tenth, this comprehensive guide will help you navigate the country like a pro.</p><h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900'>Visa and Entry Requirements</h2><p class='mb-6'>Many nationalities enjoy visa-free entry for up to 30 days (air arrival) or 15 days (land border). Ensure your passport has at least 6 months validity. The Tourist Visa (TR) allows 60-day stays, extendable for another 30 days at immigration offices. Always check current requirements before traveling.</p><h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900'>Best Time to Visit</h2><p class='mb-6'>November to February offers the best weather with cooler temperatures and low humidity—perfect for exploring. March to May is hot season (up to 40°C), but great for beach destinations. June to October is monsoon season; while wet, it offers fewer crowds and lower prices. Southern islands have different patterns, so research your specific destination.</p><h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900'>Cultural Etiquette</h2><p class='mb-6'>Thais are incredibly welcoming but appreciate cultural respect. Always remove shoes before entering temples and homes. Dress modestly at religious sites—cover shoulders and knees. The royal family is highly revered; never disrespect them. Use the traditional 'wai' greeting (hands pressed together, slight bow) when appropriate. Pointing with feet or touching heads is considered rude.</p><h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900'>Money Matters</h2><p class='mb-6'>Thai Baht (THB) is the currency. ATMs are widespread but charge fees (150-220 THB per transaction). Credit cards are widely accepted in cities but carry cash for markets and rural areas. Exchange rates are best at banks or Super Rich money changers (not at airports). Bargaining is expected at markets but not in malls.</p><h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900'>Transportation</h2><p class='mb-6'>Domestic flights connect major cities cheaply and quickly. Buses and trains offer scenic routes; overnight sleeper trains are comfortable and economical. In Bangkok, use BTS/MRT for efficiency. Grab (like Uber) operates in major cities. Songthaews (shared trucks) and tuk-tuks are fun for short trips—always agree on price first.</p><h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900'>Health and Safety</h2><p class='mb-6'>Thailand is generally safe for tourists. Drink bottled water, be cautious with street food hygiene. Travel insurance is essential. Hospitals in major cities offer excellent care—Bangkok and Phuket have international-standard facilities. Dengue fever exists; use insect repellent. Scams targeting tourists occur; stay vigilant at tourist hotspots.</p><p class='text-lg mt-8 font-semibold'>With proper planning and cultural awareness, Thailand promises an unforgettable journey filled with warm smiles, delicious food, and breathtaking experiences.</p>`,
